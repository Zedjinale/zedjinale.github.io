    <h2> Welcome to Learn Georgian as West European course</h2>

    <p> i will try my best to teach you Georgian assuming that you are English
         or other west European language speaker.</p>
         <div class="cover">
         <ol>We will cover  
         <li>1.Georgian alphabet</li>
         <li>2. basic vocabulary</li>
         <li>3. Grammar </li>
         <ol>
         </div>

         <ul>Facts about Alphabet:
 <li> Georgian alphabet is one of true alphabets that exists already for 23  Centuries.
    * Traditional story - Alphabet introduced by King Pharnavaz I in 300 BC. 
* Olderst Archeological evidence fro 5th Century AD.</li> 

<li> 2.Georgian Alphabet consists of 33 letters. Each letter has only one unique sound.
     There are NO digraphs or trigraps. 
     (Letters that make different sound while written together like th in English for example) </li>
  <li> You can write down exactly what you Hear, which makes your life easier to make new notes
     after you memorised the letters of course 😊</li>
<li> There are no capital letters, Equality! ⚖️</li>
<li> There are no genders (like he, she it) or articles in language (like a, the) 😱</li>
<li>Georgian language is not related to any other language group ( for example Indo-European or Turkish.) 
    Only relation is proto-Kartvelian (Sakartvelo means Georgia in Georgian language) and cousin languages
     from Kartvelian family including: Megrelian, Svan, Laz, which also use Georgian alphabet.
      You might read it but do not understand it 🫢 </li>
      </ul> 

<p>Tip to get zero hate in Georgia:
    Never associate Georgians with Russians or US state of Georgia. 
    We are not the same, not even close 😁</p>
<p>Enough of Nerdy stuff but this is the information Georgians would appriciate you to know.</p>
<p>Wise man said - In order to learn something new, you should make association with something already familiar.
     I will give it a try to show you similarity of Georgian and Western European languages
      by pronunciation ( English, German, Spanish, French, italian.)
It's really rare to be familiar of all the sounds or even languages so if you can not pronounce them
 put them in Google translate to listen ( i mean Western European languages, 
 Georgian auditory part is not available on Google translate) 
</p>

<p>This is overview of whole Alphabet. You can' t learn all 33 letters in one learning session. ( I dare you! )
     but do not worry! first we will learn 5 letters, build Georgian words and even sentences with them
      and than each part will provide 2 additional letters, so in total we will divide lessons in 15 parts.
<p> it will be fun, Trust the process! 🤗</p>
